	<h3 class="bio">AutoBio</h3> 
	<p>The story starts in such a beutiful setting in an Island called whale Island. It is called Whale Island because it lookes like a whale. In the beginning their is a little boy
		named Gon, he lives in Whale Island with his Aunt Mito. Unfortunatley his mother has passed away, and his father is well out. His Father is what you would call a hunter. 
	    A hunter is baisically a person that seeks to find the secrets in the world. Thats just a backstory, but their is many different types of hunters. Such as a gormet hunter. Which is hunter that seeks to find tasty undiscovered food. Also hunters that look for new species, and hunters that are called blacklist hunters. The cool badass hunters. They are the hunterst that are highered for assasination, or as body guards. Anyway many people seek to become hunters infact millions. Why? Well because you get many advantages such as money.Access to places, and information no one else can. If you sell a hunter license you can make atleast 500 million. You can live off of that for your entire lifetime. That is one of the many reasons people would like to become hunters. Theirs a lot more to it then that, but the story goes on as Gon looks for his father possibly the best hunter in the world after Gon himself becomes a hunter, and makes friends while taking the exam. He goes on to try to become strong looking for cluse to find his father while at the same time going to missions to improve his skills, and strength. He becomes a great hunter on all these missions. Gains new powers, and seeks his father out. The story is much longer then that after all the story is 32 books, and more books to come. The great Seif Awad has read 28 of the books. Each one with like 21 chapters long. The story is too long to explain in a few lines alone infact. To summarize the whole series is gonna need a book. </p>
