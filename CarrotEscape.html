										<h2>Overview</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My friend and colleague, Youssef Zayed, and I created Carrot Escape with the Unity Engine and C#/Javascript programming languages. The idea of the game was that a Carrot in a radioactive laboratory was brought to life, and as it attemts to escape the laboratory there are obstacles including enemies which are junk food. The game reached the point where the carrot ran as the user attempted to jump over obstacles, and a high score is recorded for the longest amount of time the user is able to stay alive until they inevitably lose. </p>

												<h3>How It Was Created</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Carrot Escape was created with the usage of a combination of Unity game engine, iPad drawing tools, and C# and Javascript programming languages. My partner and I worked on it in different countries so our communication was strictly online, and we shared files through google drive, and other online programs that allowed us to share our work together. Note: The background image in the menu that you can see on the left was drawn by my good friend and excellent artist Soheil Alahmar.  </p>

												<h3>The 2D Animation</h3>
											</header>
											<p> The 2D animations were all hand-drawn movement by movement by me on an ipad with the usage of a stylus. I drew the animation of dozens of different characters, many of which were never used in the game. The animations that you will see in the demo we created is the running and jumping animations, but I also drew attacking animations, and a lot of enemy animations that were never used because we stopped the development of the game early.</p>

												<h3>The Map, Props, and Menu</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The art was all self-drawn on an iPad. All props, trees, clouds, and anything else was self drawn.
												I dont consider my self a drawing artist, but I utilized online works as inspiration and traced and modified them to fit our game.

									</header>
									<p>Here you can play a demo of Carrot Escape. The demo features the carrot running and jumping until it either hits an obstacle or falls in a pit, and then a hi-score is recorded. 
										The demo is obviously missing the enemies that we wanted to include, although all the art and the animation was completed we stopped development 
										before adding them to the game.
